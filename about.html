    <p>Tewodros Kassahun, better known as Teddy Afro, is an acclaimed Ethiopian
      pop star known for his uplifting and often politically motivated songs. Born
      in Addis Ababa in 1976, Afro made his debut in 2001 with the album Abugida,
      quickly establishing himself as a prominent voice in his native country.
      Mixing reggae, traditional Ethiopian styles, and pop music, his sophomore LP,
      2005's Yastesereyal.
    <p>In 2007,riding high from his success, Afro was involved in an auto accident in which
      a young homeless man was killed. Charged with hit-and-run and vehicular manslaughter,
      Afro served two years in prison, though there was a good deal of controversy
      surrounding his sentencing by what many considered to be a vindictive government.
      Upon his 2009 release, he performed a comeback concert at Addis Ababa Stadium for
      a massive crowd of 60,000. 2012 saw the greatly anticipated release of Afro's
      fourth LP, Tikur Sew, a powerful, historically inspired album celebrating the
      battle of Adwa in which Ethiopia fought off Italy to remain uncolonized.
      The album was a major success at home and significantly raised his profile
      internationally. Bolstered by frequent touring and high-profile appearances
      around the world, Afro's next release, 2017's critically lauded Ethiopia,
      debuted at number one on Billboard's World Music chart.</p>
